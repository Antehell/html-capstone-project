            <h3>I constantly want to learn more and explore what it is to be human. I have worked at a theater and now I am eager to learn everything I can about web development, e-commerce and AI.</h3>

        <h3>Summery</h3>
            <p>At the end of may in 2024 I will have finished my 2 year long higher vocational education to become a e-commerce project manager. Before that I worked for almost 12 years as a dramapedagog and 9 of those years I spent at a theatre where I met the younger audience in different ways. Sometimes we talked and explored the subjects that the play was about. Other times it was all about lowering the threshould to the theatre. I have seen projects through from idea until its finished. I see my self as someone who isn't afraid to think out of the box and someone who enjoy change and have a need to learn more and never stand still. </p>
